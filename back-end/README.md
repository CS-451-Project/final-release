# Giving Tree API

An API implementation of a back end for our CS 451R senior class project.

## Project Information

This is a school project provided by Commerce Bank for out capstone senior project. The requirement is to
build a full-stack web project that lets users create fundraisers, donate to fundraisers, and more. This as a 
standalone project, and the design isn't supposed to emulate Commerce Bank necessarily.

### Technology Stack

Our project utilizes ASP.NET Core, C#, AWS, Azure, PostgreSQL, React, and JavaScript.

## How to Use

Using [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) is reccomended. VSCode works as well, 
but Visual Studio provides a lot of built in functionality
that is useful for ASP.NET Core projects.

### For first time use:

- Pull the repo down to your machine
- Open the `GivingCircle.Api.sln` file with Visual Studio 2022
- Now you can work on this project

### Running in Visual Studio 2022:

- Run in debug mode from the GivingCircle.Api startup mode
- You can also hit F5 to start degug mode
- If the API project is running successfully, then a `https://localhost:7000/` browser will pop 
up with a page not found error

### Testing Endpoints with Postman

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a popular and useful tool for testing web API's
- You can use it to hit your local endpoints with http requests and view the responses, and much more
